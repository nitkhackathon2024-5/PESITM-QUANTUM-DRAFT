brief description: 
Here’s a concise description for your Flask web application:

This app is a question-and-answer platform where users can register, log in, ask questions, and respond to others. It includes:

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out. A session is managed for each user, allowing personalized interactions.
- **Question & Response System**: Users can ask questions and offer points as payment. Other users can submit responses to these questions.
- **Payment and Score Tracking**: Users earn points for solving questions, and payments are made between users. A scoreboard ranks users based on their accumulated points.
- **Flask & SQLAlchemy**: Flask handles the web interface, while SQLAlchemy manages the SQLite database, which stores user, question, and response information.

This structure creates a dynamic, interactive platform with a simple, intuitive user experience.
